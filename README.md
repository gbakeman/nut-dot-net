The software is built to control and monitor many features of power devices and provides a common protocol for communicating to other devices across a network.

# What this project does
NUT.Net is inspired by the [WINNut](https://github.com/gawindx/WinNUT-Client) client. This project intends to create a compliant and efficient .Net library that can be used by any .Net application.
